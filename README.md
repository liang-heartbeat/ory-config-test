# Ory

It is used to control ory configuration files, such as identity schema, permission rules.

## Update Configuration
### Update identity schema
It only needs to update `./identity/identity.json` file, and pushes to github repo.
### Update permission rule
It only needs to update `./permission/permissionRule.ts` file, and pushes to github repo.

## Run Locally
It uses ory project api to manage configuration. The way to make project api work is a little bit tricky. You could find relative passage in reference. The whole logic is in the `index.ts` file. If you want to play with it locally, please provide several env parameters and run 
1. env 
  - USER_NAME: The username which is used to login ory console (also is used in `ory auth` cli). 
  - PASSWORD: The password which is used to login ory console (also is used in `ory auth` cli).
  - PROJECTID: It could be found with `ory list projects` cli.
  - PROJECT_SLUG: It could be found with `ory list projects` cli.
  - PROJECT_NAME: It could be found in ory console ui page.
2. run module
```shell

USER_NAME=${replace_USER_NAME} PASSWORD=${replace_PASSWORD} PROJECTID=${replace_PROJECTID} PROJECT_SLUG=${replace_PROJECT_SLUG} PROJECT_NAME=${replace_PROJECT_NAME} npm run update

```
## Configruation with Ory Commands
The following are example ory commands about configuration management. It should be carefully used in production environment. It is recommended use github actions to maintain configurations because of version control.
### Identity schema
1. Define identity schema. It is defined in the `./identity/identity.json`. A tutorial for define identity schema. [Customize identity schemas](https://www.ory.sh/docs/kratos/manage-identities/customize-identity-schema)

2. Update identity schema by ory command.[Creating identity schemas](https://www.ory.sh/docs/identities/model/manage-identity-schema)

```shell
# Encode your schema to Base64 and export it to a variable.
schema=$(cat ./identity/identity.json | base64)

# Update your project's configuration. 
# You should provide your-project-id, unique-schema-id.
# TODO: unique schema id is not generated by uploading the schema
ory patch identity-config {your-project-id} \
  --replace '/identity/default_schema_id="{unique-schema-id}"' \
  --replace '/identity/schemas=[{"id":"{unique-schema-id}","url":"base64://'$schema'"}]'

```

### Update permission rule and relationship
1. Update permission rule. It is defined in the `./permission/permissionRule.ts`.

2. Upload latest permission rule to ory by command.

```shell

  # 1. Get your project id
  ory ls projects
  # output:
  # ID					                          SLUG			              STATE	NAME
  # 143f18ba-304b-40d2-8894-f479b1007961	busy-hellman-zobf672u9m	running	ory-keto
  # 477b5a61-e78c-416e-af75-60b6f0238f77	festive-bohr-mdsepi9aam	running	orange dev
  # ca3be4df-eaa7-4d12-83be-f0f7af0141de	eager-raman-ag5yd5pxpy	running	play-with-ory

  # 2. Apply that configuration, replace project_id
  ory patch opl --project $project_id -f file://./permission/permissionRule.ts
  # outputs:
  # map[limit:map[] namespaces:map[location:https://storage.googleapis.com/bac-gcs-production/c8d4d5931bbd24126d563debb5e8d8d0c232022afa4eefd40e641f6ed56e1e6ab9b04da48e951fb77c3078cfebe4b13665a9b421f683422a2a4df8b9033feabc.bin]]

```
3. Update relationship definition. It is defined in the `relationship.json`. It is used for initializing the first actor permission in ory. Orange should support setup relationships in UI for following users and organisations.

4. Upload latest relationship to ory by command.

```shell
  # 1. create relationship
  ory create relationships ./permission/relationship.json
  # outputs:
  # NAMESPACE	    OBJECT				               RELATION NAME SUBJECT
  # Actor		      heartbeat-user			         user		       8c94cb84-0275-4722-871c-5f7327772d85
  # Group		      heartbeat-developer-group	   members		   8c94cb84-0275-4722-871c-5f7327772d85
  # Organisation	heartbeat			               reader		     Group:heartbeat-developer-group#members
  # Folder		    heartbeat-permission		     parent		     Organisation:heartbeat
  # File		      heartbeat-permission-read	   parent		     Folder:heartbeat-permission

  # 2. check permission
  ory is allowed 8c94cb84-0275-4722-871c-5f7327772d85 read Folder heartbeat-permission
  # outputs:
  # Allowed
```
